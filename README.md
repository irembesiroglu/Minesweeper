# Minesweeper
A popular type of logic puzzle video game for PCs is called Minesweeper. The game consists of a clickable tile grid with buried "mines" (which in the original game were represented as naval mines) strewn all over the board. With the aid of hints on the quantity of nearby mines in each area, the goal is to clear the board without setting off any mines. Expanding upon the fundamental ideas, several versions of Minesweeper have been created, including Minesweeper X, Crossmines, and Minehunt. Other games have included Minesweeper as a minigame, such RuneScape and the 2015 April Fools' Day update for Minecraft.

It's uncertain where Minesweeper came from. TechRadar claims that Microsoft Minesweeper from 1990 was the first game; nevertheless, Mined-Out by Ian Andrew from 1983 is cited by Eurogamer as the original Minesweeper game. Microsoft Minesweeper's developer, Curt Johnson, admits that his game's design was lifted from another game, albeit he can't recall which one it was and it wasn't Mined-Out.
